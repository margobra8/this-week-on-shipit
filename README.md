# This week on #shipit

Online showcase of the projects made by Hack Club members over the time of a week.

Will interact with the Slack API and pull the different links in the #shipit channel in the team and showcase them in the page along with a description from the GitHub API.

## TODOs:
- [x] Frontend wireframing
- [x] Frontend final mockup
- [ ] Decide what backend to use (maybe Python)
- [ ] Backend models (pymongo / python-sqlite3)
- [ ] Slack API wrapper ([python-slack-client](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient))
- [ ] Setup webhooks (maybe unnecesary, only reading from channel)
- [ ] GitHub API wrapper ([github-Flask](https://github.com/cenkalti/github-flask))
